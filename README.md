# Tasks with C

## Description

This repository contains a series of C programming examples (demos) designed to illustrate fundamental and intermediate concepts in the C language. From simple "Hello, World!" programs to menu-driven applications and file I/O, each demo focuses on a specific task or feature to help you build and reinforce your C programming skills.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following demo files:

- **demo0**: Basic program structure (e.g., `Hello, World!`)
- **demo1**: Arithmetic operations (sum of two numbers)
- **demo2**: Conditional statements (even or odd check)
- **demo3**: Loop constructs (factorial calculation)
- **demo4**: Prime number checking
- **demo5**: Fibonacci sequence generation
- **demo6menu**: Menu-driven program to select and run demos
- **demo7**: Swapping two values (using a temporary variable or pointers)
- **demo8**: Reversing a number or string
- **demo9**: Armstrong number verification
- **demo10**: Palindrome check for numbers/strings
- **demo11menu**: Enhanced menu-driven demo with extended options
- **demo12**: Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort)
- **demo13**: Search algorithms (e.g., Linear Search)
- **demo14**: Binary Search implementation
- **demo15**: Pointer fundamentals and pointer arithmetic
- **demo16**: Dynamic memory allocation (using `malloc`/`free`)
- **demo17**: Structures and `typedef`
- **demo18**: File input/output operations
- **demo19**: Use of unions and enums
- **demo20**: Advanced pointer concepts (pointer-to-pointer, function pointers)

*Note: File extensions (`.c`) are implicit; e.g., `demo0.c`, `demo1.c`, etc.*

## Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on your system.
- Basic familiarity with the command line.

## Compilation and Execution

1. **Compile a demo**

   ```bash
   gcc demoX.c -o demoX
   ```

   Replace `demoX.c` with the desired demo file (e.g., `demo0.c`).

2. **Run the program**

   ```bash
   ./demoX
   ```

3. **Menu-driven demos** (`demo6menu` or `demo11menu`)

   - Compile and run as above.
   - Follow on-screen prompts to select and execute specific demos.
